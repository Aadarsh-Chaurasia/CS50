1. Created bootstrap starter tamplate.

2. Created a `container` and put header and some other text in it.
3. Centered whole container with `text-center` class.

4. Added external css with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`

5. Added some more text then created a `row` div that will contain all the state images (3 as of now).
6. Added images and made them circular using `rounded-circular`, since they were not perfectly circular, hardcoded height and width.

7. Creating a Crousel.
